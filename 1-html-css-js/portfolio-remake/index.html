      <h2>8-Bits (Or 1 Byte) About Me</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I'm currently 18 years old, and my interest in programming came at a
          very young age and I've been coding (technically) for about 5 or 6
          years now;
        </li>
        <li>
          My dream is to be able to make a living out of making games that
          inspire people in the same way the games I played throughout my life
          inspired me, and right now I'm working really hard to achieve this
          goal;
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently I've made games using 3 different engines: Construct, GB
          Studio and Unity;
        </li>
        <li>
          I refuse to show most of my early games in this website because they
          are really embarrassing and unprofessional;
        </li>
        <li>
          Apparently I'm really organized in general, which comes with the
          advantage that I can work somewhat nicely with other people, so I
          would be glad to contribute to projects other than my own if time
          allows it;
        </li>
        <li>
          I plan on getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences in an
          university outside of Brazil in the near future. No guarantees though;
        </li>
        <li>
          My 3 favorite games are Dark Souls, Undertale and Super Mario Galaxy,
          in no particular order.
        </li>
        <li>
          I really do not enjoy making websites or writing about myself, so I'll
          leave you wondering how much fun I had making this portoflio.
