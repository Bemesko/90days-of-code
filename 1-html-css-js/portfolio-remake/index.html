    <h2>8-Bits (Or 1 Byte) About Me</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I'm currently 17 years old, and my interest in programming came at a
        very young age and I've been coding (technically) for about 5 or 6 years
        now;
      </li>
      <li>
        My dream is to be able to make a living out of making games that inspire
        people in the same way the games I played throughout my life inspired
        me, and right now I'm working really hard to achieve this goal;
      </li>
      <li>
        Currently I've made games using 3 different engines: Construct, GB
        Studio and Unity;
      </li>
      <li>
        I refuse to show most of my early games in this website because they are
        really embarrassing and unprofessional;
      </li>
      <li>
        Apparently I'm really organized in general, which comes with the
        advantage that I can work somewhat nicely with other people, so I would
        be glad to contribute to projects other than my own if time allows it;
      </li>
      <li>
        I plan on getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences in an
        university outside of Brazil in the near future. No guarantees though;
      </li>
      <li>
        My 3 favorite games are Dark Souls, Undertale and Super Mario Galaxy, in
        no particular order.
      </li>
      <li>
        I really do not enjoy making websites or writing about myself, so I'll
        leave you wondering how much fun I had making this portoflio.
