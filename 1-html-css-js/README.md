# Javascript

## Stuff I might do

- [ ] Make a web page for the 90 days of code challenge
- [ ] Remake my portfolio (will serve as a foundation for other projects throughout the challenge, such as React)
- [ ] Get more familiar with asynchronous functions
- [ ] Try to make a Coding Train project (preferably that doesn't involve P5.js)
